## Mitigating the Risks of Generative AI: Deepfake Detection and Prevention


### Project Details
With the latest advancements in generative AI and the widespread accessibility of models and
hardware, deepfakes are becoming more prevalent, hyper-realistic, and harder to distinguish from
authentic media. The ability to manipulate audio, images, and videos with high fidelity and minimal
expertise has significantly lowered the barrier for malicious use. This poses serious threats,
including fraud, identity theft, misinformation, and the erosion of public trust in digital content,
highlighting the urgent need for robust detection mechanisms and ethical safeguards.

We propose a model that uses deep learning models to detect deepfakes.
